My name is Michael Fredriksson and are from Sweden.

Currently I'm mainly program in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP och MySql

From the beginning, I'm self-taught in web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
At the end of 2023 I decided that I wanted to invest in web development full-time and am therefore taking Fullstack courses to develop myself and really learn in depth about HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP and Python and to be able to get a certificate as proof of my knowledge.

In 2017 I was tasked with creating a competition system for a growing dog sport [Swedish Nose Work Club](https://snwktavling.se) and have since developed and maintained the system. In 2022, I received an assignment from another dog club [Swedish Hoopers Club](https://shoktavling.se) to create their competition system as well.
These systems are made as standalone CMS and writen mostly in PHP, they are hardcoded to Swedish.
